## Usage

To use ASA, you can import it into your Python script or use the command-line interface (CLI).

### Importing ASA

```python
import asa

# Load your data
data = asa.load_data('path_to_your_data.csv')

# Perform descriptive statistics
summary = asa.descriptive_statistics(data)
print(summary)

# Perform a t-test
t_test_result = asa.t_test(data, 'column1', 'column2')
print(t_test_result)

# Generate a report
asa.generate_report(data, 'output_report.pdf')
```

### Using the CLI

```bash
# Load data and perform descriptive statistics
asa-cli load_data path_to_your_data.csv
asa-cli descriptive_statistics

# Perform a t-test
asa-cli t_test column1 column2

# Generate a report
asa-cli generate_report output_report.pdf
```

## Configuration

ASA allows for extensive configuration to suit your analysis needs. You can create a configuration file in JSON or YAML format to customize settings such as data cleaning options, preferred statistical methods, and report formats.

Example configuration file (config.json):

```json
{
    "data_cleaning": {
        "handle_missing": "mean",
        "remove_outliers": true
    },
    "report_format": "pdf"
}
```
