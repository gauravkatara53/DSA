About

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of code examples and solutions for common data structures and algorithms. It is organized by type and category to help you easily find and review the code you need. The main goals of this repository are to:

Practice and improve my understanding of data structures and algorithms.
Prepare for coding interviews and competitive programming.
Share my solutions with others who are also learning or preparing.
Folder Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the type of data structures and algorithms. Each folder contains relevant problems and their solutions.
