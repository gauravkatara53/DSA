## Introduction

The DSA repository is designed to provide a comprehensive resource for learning and implementing data structures and algorithms in C++. It includes explanations, example code, and test cases for each data structure and algorithm, making it easier for you to understand and apply these concepts in your projects.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Implementations**: Detailed implementations of various data structures and algorithms in C++.
- **Easy-to-Follow Explanations**: Clear and concise explanations of each data structure and algorithm.
- **Test Cases**: Example test cases to demonstrate the usage and correctness of the implementations.
- **Well-Organized Structure**: Code organized by data structures and algorithms, making it easy to find what you need.

## Installation

To get started with the DSA repository, you can clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dsa.git
cd dsa
```

Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system, such as `g++` for GCC or `clang++` for Clang.

## Usage

You can navigate through the folders to find the data structure or algorithm you are interested in. Each folder contains a README file with an explanation of the data structure or algorithm, along with the implementation and test cases.

### Example: Using a Stack in C++

1. Navigate to the `data_structures/stack/cpp` directory.
2. Open the `stack.cpp` file to view the implementation.
3. Compile and run the `test_stack.cpp` file to see example usage and test cases:

```bash
g++ stack.cpp test_stack.cpp -o test_stack
./test_stack
```

### Example: Using Quick Sort in C++

1. Navigate to the `algorithms/sorting/quick_sort/cpp` directory.
2. Open the `quick_sort.cpp` file to view the implementation.
3. Compile and run the `test_quick_sort.cpp` file to see example usage and test cases:

```bash
g++ quick_sort.cpp test_quick_sort.cpp -o test_quick_sort
./test_quick_sort
```

## Data Structures

The repository includes implementations of various data structures, such as:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, etc.)
- Heaps
